        <h1>Gift 3: Dreams With You 🌙</h1>
        <p class="gift-text">
            When I think about the future, I don’t just see places or plans… I see <em>us</em>.<br><br>
            I dream about traveling somewhere beautiful with you ❤️ maybe a quiet beach where we walk barefoot at sunset,
            or a cozy little cabin in the mountains where it’s just you, me, and the sound of the world slowing down.
            I want to hold your hand in new cities, try new foods together, get lost and laugh about it.<br><br>
            But more than the big adventures, I dream about the small things.<br>
            Sunday mornings where you’re still sleepy and I get to pull you closer. Late-night talks about everything and nothing.
            Building a home that feels warm because you’re in it.<br><br>
            And here’s my most special dream…<br><br>
            One day, I want to look at you ❤️ maybe while we’re cooking dinner or sitting on the couch after a long day —
            and feel that same spark I feel now. I want us to smile at each other like we share a secret the world doesn’t know.
            I want to grow older with you, still teasing each other, still choosing each other, still falling in love in new ways.<br><br>
            I don’t just dream about a future.<br>
            I dream about a lifetime… with you BABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. 💫
